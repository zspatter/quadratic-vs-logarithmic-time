# quadratic-vs-logarithmic-time
A comparison between O(nÂ²) and O(n logn) sorting algorithms. The algorithms chosen are insertion sort and merge sort respectively. Furthermore, each comparison is st to run 10 iterations to gather an average runtime. Finally, there is a spreadsheet tabulating the run times and gathering averages to emphasize the differences between growth rates.
